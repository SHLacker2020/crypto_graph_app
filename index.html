        "Some cryptocurrencies are inherently more energy efficient than Bitcoin. 
        Why? Because Bitcoin relies on a 'Proof of Work' system that involves huge amounts of calculations 
        (and, thus, processing power) to produce a single token. Cryptocurrencies that instead use a 'Proof of Storage' or 'Proof of Stake' 
        system use far less energy, as do currencies using a technology called block lattice, which doesn't require mining.
        Even among 'Proof of Work' cryptocurrencies, however, some are more energy intensive than others. 
        This is primarily because these currencies use ASIC-resistant algorithms that consume significantly more energy than should be expected 
        relative to how much of the cryptocurrency market they represent. 
        A good example of this is RavenCoin which, by one calculation, accounts for 4.32% of the total rated power of the 
        top 20 cryptocurrencies but has a market capitalization of just 0.06%. Interestingly, 
        Bitcoin uses an algorithm that does allow for mining ASIC-based devices, and these devices are considerably more energy efficient 
        than conventional graphic processing units (GPUs)."
