CRYPTO GRAPH

**Background**
   CryptoGraph is a single page website to accurately display the pricing data 
for The Top 5 crypto currencies. There will be features to view the history and
development information of the currency and a hover feature on the main line
chart. Icons will be used to change the currency data on the chart.
   The goal of this webpage is to allow people to read about and understand the
top crypto currencies and a brief history of each currency without having to do 
extensive searches throughout multiple sites on the web. Blockchain technology 
is a topic that isnâ€™t necessarily easy to understand, and I think my app will 
allow people to do just that.

**Functionality & MVPs**
In CryptoGraph, users will be able to:
  - Switch the chart between the top 5 currencies in the market
  - Display a pie chart of additional market data when hovering over one of the 
  currencies
  - Symbol buttons that will display a breif history of the currency and 
  developer information
  - Live animation of the market data updating

In addition, this project will include:
  - Optional links to more data on the currency or developer
  - Energy data which displays the effect on the environment each technology has

**Technologies, Libraries, API's**
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- NPM: to manage dependencies.
- Webpack: to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code.
- Charts.js: to help build the charts.
- CoinGecko: as an API to query the data for the chart.

**Implementation Timeline**
Weekend:
  - Get the project started and the file structure setup.
  - Import all of the libraries and API's needed for the project to run.
  - Add some of the HTML and features to show up on the screen.

Monday:
  - This day will be dedicated for finishing all of the logic in the app.
  - Get the main functionality of the chart to display on the screen.

Tuesday:
  - Make sure that all the features built are being displayed correctly.
  - Start to add new features to the app if I have time and properly time all of
  user interaction async functions.

Wednesday:
  - Run all of the tests needed to make sure the app is running properly and 
  efficiently
