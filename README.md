## Background ##
CryptoGraph is a single page data visualition web application made to accurately
display the kWh (Kilowatts per Hour) per transaction. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour )
for Cardano, Polkadot, Dogecoin and Solana which aim to have some of the most
environmentally friendly blockchain transactions and still have some lucrative
market data.

**Functionality & MVPs**
In CryptoGraph, users will be able to:
  - Switch the chart between the top 5 currencies in the market
  - Display a pie chart of additional market data when hovering over one of the 
  currencies
  - Symbol buttons that will display a breif history of the currency and 
  developer information
